  dialogues:
  - The painting depicts a serene landscape, a peaceful scene of a forest and a lake.
    Something about it feels unsettling
  - The painting seems to shimmer, as if it's alive
  - Your eyes are transfixed by the painting, the colours swirling and morphing into
    something sinister the more you look
  - A face appears in the painting, a distorted and grotesque visage that stares
    directly at you. The face vanishes as quickly as it appeared
  - You can swear you hear a faint whisper that seems to emanate from the painting
  - The digit glows faintly, as if imbued with magical energy. You wonder what its
    significance could be. [9]
