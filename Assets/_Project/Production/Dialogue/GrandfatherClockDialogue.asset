  dialogues:
  - The silence is broken only by the ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.
    A sense of unease creeps over you
  - The clock ticks loudly, its pendulum swinging back and forth
  - A rhythmic pattern emerges from the ticking, a strange melody that seems to dance
    on the edge of your hearing
