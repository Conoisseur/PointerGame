  dialogues:
  - The mirror is tarnished and cracked, reflecting a distorted image of yourself.
    A sense of unease washes over you
  - Touching the surface, a cold sensation spreads across your fingertips. The image
    in the mirror ripples and distorts, before returning to normal
  - The longer you look, the more the image becomes increasingly distorted, until
    it's almost unrecognisable
  - 'A faint whisper echoes from the mirror: *Look closer.*'
  - Thee image flickers and fades, replaced by a shadowy figure that quickly disappears
