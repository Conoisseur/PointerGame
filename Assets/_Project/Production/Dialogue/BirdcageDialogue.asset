  dialogues:
  - The cage is empty, save for a few scattered feathers. A sense of melancholy washes
    over you
  - A single feather flutters to the ground. The silence is broken only by the ticking
    of the grandfather clock
  - A cold draft sweeps through the room, making the cage rattle
  - A faint, almost inaudible chirping sound seems to come from the cage. You strain
    your ears, but the sound disappears as quickly as it appeared
