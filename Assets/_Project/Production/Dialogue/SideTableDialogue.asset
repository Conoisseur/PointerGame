  dialogues:
  - The plant is sickly and wilted, its leaves drooping and discoloured
  - A breeze runs through the room. The plant shudders violently, its leaves rustling
  - As you reach for the plant, dark, shadowy fingers emerge from the plant's pot.
    You pull your hand back immediately
  - The plant seems to move, its leaves twisting and turning as if reaching out to
    grab you
