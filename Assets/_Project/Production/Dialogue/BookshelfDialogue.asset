  dialogues:
  - The bookshelf is filled with dusty, leather-bound books.
  - 'You run your fingers along their spines, feeling their weight and texture. One
    book in particular seems out of place. '
  - 'The book is smaller than the others, its cover worn and faded. '
  - As you open the book, it falls open to a strange script. It seems to be a translation
    of an ancient language. [9]
