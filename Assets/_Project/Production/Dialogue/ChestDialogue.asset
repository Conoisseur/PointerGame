  - The chest is ornately carved, its surface adorned with strange symbols. A heavy
    lock secures the lid, the metal cold and unforgiving.
  - You try to tug on the lock, but it doesn't budge.
  - The chest is secured tightly, defying any attempt to open it.
  - A cold sensation grips your hand as you touch the lock. /n It feels... alive.
